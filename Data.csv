"$139,500",0,0,Land,"Lot 182 Halibut Hill Rd, Mudge Island, BC, V0V 0V0","Inside lot on beautiful Halibut Hill, minutes walk to Dodd Narrows and the ocean. Wander down with your morning coffee and watch the sea lions fishing in the current. Maybe some fishing or crabbing or prawns? There is nothing better. Mudge is accessed by private boat or water taxi which helps retain the rural character of the island. At just under 0.75 of an acre, this lot is relatively flat and hosts a number of sites that would be suitable for building a cabin or even a year round home. Power and telephone/internet run through the back of the lot giving you the option of being wired into the modern world and all its conveniences. Or you can chose the simple, peaceful life off the grid. While most people catch rainwater off their roofs for their main water supply, there is a public well available near by and the lot faces south so it is sun drenched in the summer. A real blank canvass waiting for someone to build a legacy for their family.  Private boat access only - no ferry service!","{'Property Tax': '$263 (2022)', 'Last Updated': 'Thu, July 13, 2023', 'MLS® #': '937175', 'Date Listed': 'Jul 11, 2023', 'Property Type': 'Vacant Land', 'Rooms': '0', 'Pet Policy': 'Aquariums, Birds, Caged Mammals, Cats OK, Dogs OK', 'Area': 'Islands'}"
